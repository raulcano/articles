## Introduction
My intuition tells me that creating money out of thin air is not a good thing. 

Another intuition I have is that whenever a person decides to delay spending their money and store away the value of their work, it is fair that no one should be able to arbitrarily take away their purchase power.
Money can lose purchase power with time, but not all justifications are equaly just. While natural catastrophes or a spontaneous drop in productivity will reduce a currency's purchase power, they are not unfair reasons, they are part of the complex interrelations of nature and societies that shall motivate people to protect themselves from these type of 'agentless or unintentional risks'. On the other hand, some authority arbitrarily destroying people's purchase power by printing money would not enter the category of what is fair game.

A third intuition of mine in this topic is that a non-inflationary currency, that is, a currency which supply is limited and finite, is a good candidate to store value while keeping the fairness of the system. 

Of course, not everyone has the same intuitions. In fact, many could say that even with the evils of inflation, a non-inflationary (or deflationary) currency would bring way more unfairness to the system than the inflationary alternative.

A few good arguments about such unfairness have been pointed out to me. As appealing as they may seem, I believe they are wrong, however their rebuttal is neither immediate nor obvious. I will try to address them here.

# Premises <a name="premises"></a>
For all arguments below, I assume these premises:
1) __The growth in productivity is stable.__ That is, the evolution in the means of production allows more output per unit of input continuously.
2) __The amount of money is stable.__ There are no new monetary units created.

# Argument 1: disproportionate rewards for early agents <a name="arg1"></a>

*If the amount of money is stable, and so is the productivity growth rate, then the earlier you earn money, the more purchase power you have compared to generations that enter the economy later. That is, with a non-inflationary currency, people entering early in the game are rewarded disproportionately, which is unfair.*

## Answer
In such a scenario, following from premise 1, no matter what amount of money you have, your purchase power will increase with time. Hence, it will seem to you 'unfair' if you compare yourself with the previous generation, as it will seem 'unfair' for the following generation when they compare with you.

Even if it can be perceived as 'unfair', the truth is that this continuous deflation provoked by an increase in productivity will allow you to benefit from an increasingly good standard of living, and especially the older you get (and less capable of producing). 

An unintented positive consequence of the increasing purchase power of money is that this system seems to better guarantee your retirement pension just by saving your income without taking any special risks, since you are not incentivized to do investments to beat inflation into areas you barely understand.

# Argument 2: the incentive is not on production <a name="arg2"></a>
*As soon as you have enough money, you will have no incentive to work or to produce because a continuous growth in productivity will guarantee that your purchase power increases with time.*

## Answer
There needs to be a critical mass on innovation to keep stable growth (as per premise 1), so it is false that production is not incentivized.

Unless you inherit or are gifted enough money very early in life, there is a period in which you certainly are incentived to work, until you have saved enough that you can sit in those earnings if you choose to.

It doesn't follow that you will always sit on your savings and enjoy the increasing purchase power. This is certainly a possibility, but only if you are ok with the ratio at which deflation increases your purchase power.

In this deflationary scenario, you would be incentivized to invest your savings in projects which return is bigger than the ratio at which deflation increases your purchase power. Interestingly enough, from premise 2 we get that total savings are a hard cap on investment. A society that has more savings, has a higher chance of investing in projects that will create more innovation and growth, increasing the purchase power and well-being of the current and following generations.

The projects that are funded would be the ones that promise the better disruption, increasing purchase power of following generations, and yielding higher returns to the investors than the ratio of deflation allows them to enjoy. In fact, the growth in productivity can *only* be kept constant (premise 1) if innovation projects are funded, so premise 1 would not hold if people just sat on their money. 

To sum up, you may not be incentivized to *always* work. True. However, once you have enough savings your incentives push you to fund innovative projects that would bring prosperity and an ever-growing purchase power.

# Argument 3: rentists are favored over workers  <a name="arg3"></a>
*Work should be rewarded over saving money. It favors savers (rentists) over workers* 

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Answer
Even though a saver is not necessary a rentist I'll focus on the rentist part, since one cannot make a living *just* by saving. I understand by 'rentist' someone that obtains their income via investing their savings in real state, stocks, bonds, etc. and obtaining a return in the form of monthly rents, dividends and so on.

First, I think this argument is the most subjective of all presented here and I cannot aim to change the personal preference or the emotional side of this position. However, since this article aims to defend the fairness of the non-inflationary currency, I will focus on why there is nothing wrong or unfair with the rentist position.

In order to be a rentist you need to save money first, and that money will almost exclusively come from your work, unless you inherit or receive a generous gift. At some point, you will have saved enough and you can keep working if you wish, you can put your money to work for you (i.e. becoming a rentist), or you can do both.

I fail to see what is wrong with risking your honest-earned savings in endeavors that are equally honest and legit. Let's not forget that any investment of a 'rentist' involves both a service given to someone that values it (e.g. a house to live in) and a risk incurred (e.g. tenants not paying), so it is only fair that the rentist receives a return based on both value added and risk taken. 

Additionally, if you favor income coming from work over income coming from rent, you are free to keep working as much as you want. The positive side of the deflationary scenario I am defending in this article is that any person that prefers the lifestyle of an inflationary world, can actually keep having that same lifestyle if they wish so. 
Additionally, they have an open door to new lifestyle if they save enough through their work. Plus, nobody is diluting their savings arbitrarily.

In a way, this seems to me an incredibly beneficial state of things, in which your savings will almost certainly allow you a freer future and where you don't need to trust your savings in obscure investment schemes to avoid inflation eating up your money.

Again, if there is anything unfair in that, I fail to see it.

# Argument 4: wealth concentration <a name="arg4"></a>
*A non-inflationary currency, along with ever-growing productivity would derive in a dangerously high level of wealth concentration by older generations.*

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Answer

In order to keep a constant growth (premise 1) you need innovation to happen. The investment on innovation must come from those who own enough savings. Since younger generations won't have the money to invest, that pressure goes to the wealthier (usually older) members of society, the people that can allow such investments.

One can assume that not all projects will succeed and not all investors will increase their wealth equally. In fact, true innovation comes from a disproportionately low percentage of all started projects. This means that the unsuccessful endeavours would have redistributed the wealth of the investors back into society through the salaries of staff, purchases of capital and any other expenses incurred, without making the investors richer. This leakage of funds is a way in which the market prevents an ever-increasing accumulation of wealth.

Even if wealth were more and more concentrated with time, our premises ensure that new people entering the economy will nevertheless grow their purchase power with time.

In an alternative scenario where money can be printed, it doesn't follow that wealth is more evenly distributed. In fact, history shows that those closest to the money printing machine are the ones usually benefitted by this possibility, as described by the Cantillon effect.


# Argument 5: your wealth depends mostly on when you are born <a name="arg5"></a>
*Your wealth depends on when you are born, so deflation is unfair.*

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

## Answer
This argument is similar to argument 1, however I want to offer a different way to answer here, turning it upside down. 

In historical terms, the difference of wealth across time has always been the case. Everyone born today has a better standard of living than previous generations by no merit of their own. Following the argument we would be saying that it is unfair that we own so much wealth compared to our ancestors. Since we cannot do anything to increase the wealth of dead generations, the only way to make things right would be to destroy our own wealth until both generations are even.
I don't think anyone would advocate for this crazy type of fairness, and yet we can agree that we are way better off than our ancestors by no merit of our own. 

I argue that this unevenness of purchase power among generations is part of the evolutionary game, and is by no means unfair. It is in fact a desirable outcome of our societies. In the same way, by building on previous innovations, by leveraging lessons learned of our present, future generations will have better standards of living than we have today.

One could say that my answer to the argument dodges the question. Deflation makes older generations wealthier, and not the younger ones as I have described.

The argument focused on the unfairness of deflation due to your wealth depending on when you are born, which is no merit of yours. Hence, if it is unfair that older generations are wealthier just by being born earlier, it is equally unfair that younger generations are wealthier just by bein born later. Since we do not see the latter as unfair, we shall not see the former as unfair either.

# Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

My intuitions lead me to believe that a prosperous economy must be deflationary by necessity. That is, the continuous growth of productivity paired with a non-inflationary currency allows *everyone* to be better off, especially in comparison with inflationary alternatives. That is not only fair, but highly desirable.

This article has been my attempt to address a few arguments against the perceived unfairness of a deflationary scenario. I believe they are appealing arguments, but wrong.

If we assume a stable growth in productivity paired with a deflationary currency, it follows that people entering early in such economy will profit enormously, but this is not necessarily an unfair state of things. The premise of a stable productivity growth guarantees that your purchase power will increase, so people entering at any point in time will equally profit compared to following generations.

Additionaly, if one prefers the lifestyle fostered by inflation, where spending is incentivized, then one is free to keep that lifestyle. Moreover, there is the added benefit that one wouldn't be doing that because one's savings are slowly dissapearing, but because one chooses to. Likewise, a person can choose to have a lifestyle focused on delaying spending for a better time, saving their hard-earned money without the hidden tax of inflation. There are more life options to choose from and not less.

I admit that the argument about wealth concentration is the strongest one against a deflationary currency and my answer may not be the most convincing one. I am not sure that wealth concentration is a bad thing per se, as long as purchase power keeps rising for *everyone*. Further research on this is needed. 

# Notes <a name="notes"></a>

\* Maybe printing money is not totally bad, but if it is so good, why is there still poverty in the world? The first answer that comes to mind is that money does not equal value. Money can be *used* to store value more or less successfully, but it is not the value itself. Decoupling these two concepts (value vs. store of value) is fundamental to start understanding, if only intuitively, the discussion concerning inflation, deflation and, in general, the effects of chaning the amount of money in the economy.
 
** I own bitcoin, which is a non-inflationary currency. As it has been correctly pointed out, I have a vested interest in these ideas to be correct, not just by the sake of being right, but by the personal benefit I would get. So I tried to make this argument as clear as possible guided by reason and not by any personal interest. I hope that if there are any flaws on it, I am reminded of them with as clear a counter-argument as possible.

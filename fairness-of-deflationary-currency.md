## Introduction
My intuition tells me that creating money out of thin air is not a good thing. 

Another intuition I have is that whenever a person decides to delay spending their money and store away the value of their work, it is fair that no one should be able to arbitrarily take away their purchase power.
Money can lose purchase power with time, but not all justifications are equaly just. While natural catastrophes or a spontaneous drop in productivity will reduce a currency's purchase power, they are not unfair reasons, they are part of the complex interrelations of nature and societies that shall motivate people to protect themselves from these type of 'agentless or unintentional risks'. On the other hand, some authority arbitrarily destroying people's purchase power by printing money would not enter the category of what is fair game.

A third intuition of mine in this topic is that a non-inflationary currency, that is, a currency which supply is limited and finite, is a good candidate to store value while keeping the fairness of the system. 

A few good arguments about the unfairness of a non-inflationary currency have been pointed out to me. As appealing as they may seem, I believe they are wrong, however their rebuttal is neither immediate nor obvious. I will try to address them here.

## Premises
For all arguments below, I assume these premises:
1) __The growth in productivity is stable.__ That is, the evolution in the means of production allows more output per unit of input continuously.
2) __The amount of money is stable.__ There are no new monetary units created.

## Argument 1: disproportionate rewards for early agents

If the amount of money is stable, and so is the productivity growth rate, then the earlier you earn money, the more purchase power you have compared to generations that enter the economy later. That is, with a non-inflationary currency, people entering early in the game are rewarded disproportionately, which is unfair.


### Answer to argument 1
In such a scenario, following from premise 1, no matter what amount of money you have, your purchase power will increase with time. Hence, it will seem to you 'unfair' if you compare yourself with the previous generation, as it will seem 'unfair' for the following generation when they compare with you.

Even if it can be perceived as 'unfair', the truth is that this continuous deflation provoked by an increase in productivity will allow you to benefit from an increasingly good standard of living, and especially the older you get (and less capable of producing). This system seems to better guarantee your retirement pension than any other one we know now, since you are not incentivized to invest your savings to beat inflation into areas you barely understand.

## Argument 2: the incentive is not on production
As soon as you have enough money, you will have no incentive to work or to produce because a continuous growth in productivity will guarantee that your purchase power increases with time.

### Answer to argument 2
There needs to be a critical mass on innovation to keep stable growth (as per premise 1), so it is false that production is not incentivized.

Unless you inherit or are gifted enough money very early in life, there is a period in which you certainly are incentived to work, until you have saved enough that you can sit in those earnings if you choose to.

It doesn't follow that you will always profit from the increasing purchase power just by sitting on your savings. This is certainly a possibility, but only if you are ok with the ratio at which deflation increases your purchase power.

In this deflationary scenario, you would be incentivized to invest your savings in projects which return is bigger than the ratio at which deflation increases your purchase power. Interestingly enough, from premise 2 we get that total savings are a hard cap on investment. A society that has more savings, has a higher chance of investing in projects that will create more innovation and growth, increasing the purchase power and well-being of the current and following generations.

The projects that are funded would be the ones that promise the better disruption, increasing purchase power of following generations, and yielding higher returns to the investors than the ratio of deflation allows them to enjoy. In fact, the growth in productivity can *only* be kept constant (premise 1) if innovation projects are funded, so premise 1 would not hold if people just sat on their money. 

To sum up, you may not be incentivized to *always* work. True. However, once you have enough savings your incentives push you to fund innovative projects that would bring prosperity and an ever-growing purchase power.

## Argument 3: wealth concentration
A non-inflationary currency, along with ever-growing productivity would derive in a dangerously high level of wealth concentration by older generations.

### Answer to argument 3

In order to keep a constant growth (premise 1) you need innovation to happen. The investment on innovation must come from those who own enough savings. Since younger generations won't have the money to invest, that pressure goes to the wealthier members of society, that is, the people that can allow such investments.

One can assume that not all projects will succeed and not all investors will increase their wealth equally. In fact, true innovation comes from a disproportionately low percentage of projects started. This means that the unsuccessful projects would have redistributed the wealth of the investors back into society through the salaries of staff, purchases of capital and any other expenses incurred, without making the investors richer. This leakage of funds is a way in which the market prevents an ever-increasing accumulation of wealth.

Even if wealth were more and more concentrated with time, our premises ensure that new people entering the economy will nevertheless grow their purchase power with time.

In an alternative scenario where money can be printed, it doesn't follow that wealth is more evenly distributed. In fact, history shows that those closest to the money printing machine are the ones usually benefitted by this possibility, as described by the Cantillon effect.


## Argument 4: your wealth depends mostly on when you are born
Your wealth depends on when you are born, so deflation is unfair.

### Answer to argument 4
This argument is similar to argument 1, however I want to offer a different way to answer here, turning it upside down. 

In historical terms, the difference of wealth across time has always been the case. Everyone born today has a better standard of living than previous generations by no merit of their own. Following the argument we would be saying that it is unfair that we own so much wealth compared to our ancestors. Since we cannot do anything to increase the wealth of dead generations, the only way to make things right would be to destroy our own wealth until both generations are even.
I don't think anyone would advocate for this crazy type of fairness, and yet we can agree that we are way better off than our ancestors by no merit of our own. 

I argue that this unevenness of purchase power among generations is part of the evolutionary game, and is by no means unfair. It is in fact a desirable outcome of our societies. In the same way, by building on previous innovations, by leveraging lessons learned of our present, future generations will have better standards of living than we have today.

One could say that my answer to the argument dodges the question. Deflation makes older generations wealthier, and not the younger ones as I have described.

The argument focused on the unfairness of deflation due to your wealth depending on when you are born, which is no merit of yours. Hence, if it is unfair that older generations are wealthier just by being born earlier, it is equally unfair that younger generations are wealthier just by bein born later. Since we do not see the latter as unfair, we shall not see the former as unfair either.

## Conclusions
My intuitions lead me to believe that a prosperous economy must be deflationary by necessity. That is, the continuous growth of productivity paired with a non-inflationary currency allows *everyone* to be better off, especially in comparison with any inflationary alternatives.

This article has been my attempt to address a few arguments against the perceived unfairness of a deflationary scenario. I believe they are appealing arguments, but wrong.

If we assume a stable growth in productivity paired with a deflationary currency, it follows that people entering early in such economy will profit enormously, but this is not necessarily an unfair state of things. The premise of a stable productivity growth guarantees that your purchase power will increase, so people entering at any point in time will equally profit compared to the following generations.

I admit that the argument about wealth concentration is the strongest one against a deflationary currency and my answer may not be the most convincing one. I am not sure that wealth concentration is a bad thing per se, as long as purchase power keeps rising for *everyone*. Further research on this is needed. 

## Notes
\* Maybe printing money is not totally bad, but if it is so good, why is there still poverty in the world? The first answer that comes to mind is that money does not equal value. Money can be *used* to store value more or less successfully, but it is not the value itself. Decoupling these two concepts (value vs. store of value) is fundamental to start understanding, if only intuitively, the discussion concerning inflation, deflation and, in general, the effects of chaning the amount of money in the economy.
 
** I own bitcoin, which is a non-inflationary currency. As it has been correctly pointed out, I have a vested interest in these ideas to be correct, not just by the sake of being right, but by the personal benefit I would get. So I tried to make this argument as clear as possible guided by reason and not by any personal interest. I hope that if there are any flaws on it, I am reminded of them with as clear a counter-argument as possible.

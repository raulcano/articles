# Price stability revisited

![Price stability revisited](./images/6922.jpg "Price stability revisited")

Since I wrote my initial articles about the fairness of a non-inflationary currency ([1](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md), [2](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/second-defense-non-inflationary-currency.md), [3](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/printing-money-bad-policy.md)), I have continued having interesting conversations on this topic and I was even interviewed by Alberto Mera in his "[Podcast about Bitcoin](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Uo1zWEUIDj9lpuGwshsSB)". I found that one particular defense of inflation is particularly recurrent: the argument from "price stability", which I probably haven't addressed as deeply as I should have. I believe this argument in support of monetary expansion is as wrong as the rest, however, it has some appeal that makes it intuitively attractive. Price stability is good, right?

# The argument from price stability <a name="arg"></a>
*The amount of new money created (inflation) should mirror the increase in productivity to compensate for it. The economy would then be more predictable and fair this way.*

## Answer 1: Impracticality <a name="ans1"></a>
I addressed the argument against [price stability here](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/second-defense-non-inflationary-currency.md#arg1), however, this one is a variation worth debating (and debunking, hopefully).  

Imagine a baker regularly sells her bread for 1€ a piece. Thanks to a disruptive technology, production costs drop significantly and the baker starts selling bread at 0.5€ a piece. This would mean an increase in productivity of 100%, that is, she can now produce 2 pieces of bread with the costs of producing 1 before the technological improvements.  
The present argument would defend that the central bank should produce 100% more money in order to mirror the increase of productivity in the bread business. In this case, the price of bread would remain 1€ (even with the productivity improvement) as the new money printed would have the effect of an increase in prices. Knowing that bread would have a fixed price of 1€ brings predictability to the market, or so the argument goes.

However, there are many problems with this. The first obvious answer is that this solution is impracticable. Of course, bread is just one good out of hundreds of thousands goods and services in the economy (millions, more likely), and the increase in money supply should reflect *all* goods and services not just bread. Should the money supply be changed everytime there is a change in productivity in each good and service? How often? How to manage that? This reason alone is enough to reject the argument from price stability.

## Answer 2: Consumer price indices <a name="ans2"></a>
Notwithstanding, let's assume that in order to approximate the *overall* change (increase or decrease) in productivity we define an index of products and services that would be representative of the economy, averaging changes of productivity, so the central bank would print as much new money as productivity has increased according to the index. In this way, the argument goes, prices would remain stable but wages would go up (or down) according to the improvements in productivity, which would be fair and predictable.

For example, with an overall productivity increase of 5%, products on average would be then 5% cheaper. Therefore, to keep prices at the same level as before, the central bank needs to print 5% more money.

First answer to this is to point out the impossibility of setting a fair reference price of any particular product or service. The setting of such reference is going to be arbitrary by necessity for these reasons:
- When is the reference price of a particular prouct set?
- How do you classify what is one product different from another? Who decides how to difference particular goods (e.g. white bread vs corn bread vs pumpernickel).
- Are we creating as much new money according to the increase in productivity of *all* products or *some* of them? Why reject some?

Rothbard explains the previous very eloquently in "The Ethics of Money Production":

  _"If the price of telephones increases while the price of cars drops, it is impossible to say by any impartial standard whether the PPM has increased or decreased. One can of course make up some algorithm that “weighs” the prices of cars and telephones and so on, and brings them under a common mathematical expression or index. But such indices are not some sort of constant measuring stick of economic value. For one thing, the constituents of the price index are in need of incessant adaptation (they need to be changed) to take account of the changes in the array of goods and services offered on the market in exchange for money. Moreover, and most importantly, no such index conveys generally valid information. Different persons buy different goods; therefore, some of them might experience a rise of prices (of the prices they have to pay) while others experience a drop of (their) prices in the very same period. The quantitative statement of the index reflects just an average of very different concrete situations. But it is concrete circumstances, not some average, that count for human decision-making."_

Additionally, Rothbard adds one of the main risks introduced by the approach of the PPM (Purchase Price Multiple):

  _"The PPM criterion gives great and arbitrary powers to those charged with making up the algorithm."_

This seems a minor point but certainly it is not. Every time an index is created for this purpose, we introduce a tempting and pernicious incentive for producers to intensively lobby the person(s) in charge of such index according to each particular group's interests. The selection of goods and their weigh are then linked to pressures, arbitrary decisions and, eventually, corruption.
In the end, the quanitity of new money printed would be the result in part of which lobbies have succeeded the most in adding or removing products from such index, instead of what is "objectively" the overall productivity change.

## Answer 3: Wages <a name="ans3"></a>
What about wages? This is a different and less obvious answer. Imagine we could accomplish an inflation pegged to productivity where the prices of goods and services change accordingly. Should we then increase or decrease wages as well?

There are two options:
1. __Wages change as well with productivity increase__. That is, if productivity increases by 5%, the central bank prints 5% more money and wages increase by that same percentage as well. Let's not forget that wages are also a price of a particular service (the time and skills of the worker), so if the original argument defends that productivity changes shall also affect products and services for the sake of predictability, we defeat the purpose by changing the wages.

2. __Wages do not change as well with productivity increase__. In this case, even with the inflation provoked by the central bank, wages shall remain constant regardless of the productivity increase. People's purchase power does not improve with new and more efficient means of production. Maybe predictability is achieved (it isn't) but it comes at the unbearable cost of not allowing any person to reap the benefits of any technological advancement. Let alone the incentive added to a market: if no one is allowed to benefit from productivity increases, why would anyone bother to produce new methods or techniques, invest their capital or assume the risks that go hand in hand with innovation?

In short, why should then prices of some products remain fixed (e.g. bread) but not other prices (e.g. wages). I guess that most people that defend the argument from price stability would go with the option 1. That is, for the sake of __predictability__, we change the money supply accordingly when the productivity of any good has increased. But it does forget that wages are also a price that needs to be accounted for economic decisions of employers, who would benefit as well of such predictability. If prices stay stable but we allow for changing wages prices we are in effect hiding information to economic actors of which products have become cheaper (or more expensive) to produce, since all that info is aggregated in wages. Their economic decisions become riskier due to the lack of detailed information on the production of goods and services. Hence, this means that predictability is __effectively lost__.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Technology is a deflationary force. That is, as productivity increases, goods and services become cheaper. We cannot predict, however, which technologies will revolutionize which areas so the best we can do is to reflect those productivity changes in the prices of the products and services affected. 

Pretending that inflating the money supply according to productivity is somehow helping to make the world more predictable, is not only naive and wrong, but also it introduces a whole new set of problems and unfairness in the system.

Wouldn't it send a clearer message to the market to directly change the price of the product that had its output affected? The argument from price stability seems to me a crazy way of seeing things and clearly the proposed solution misses the point it tries to defend (predictability).

In summary, with a rate of monetary inflation pegged to productivity, we lose information about the evolution of the means of production of products and services. Without inflation however, production knowledge is better relayed to all participants in the economy. This is because prices are then attached to each element and affected by its relevant characteristics, instead of being aggregated into arbitrary indices which are unfairly composed and ignore the individual choices of each person.

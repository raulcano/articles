## [On the fairness of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md) <a name="art1"></a>


*"My intuition tells me that creating money out of thin air is not a good thing.
Another intuition I have is that whenever a person decides to delay spending their money and store away the value of their work, it is fair that no one should be able to arbitrarily take away their purchase power. Money can lose purchase power with time, but not all justifications are equaly just. While natural catastrophes or a spontaneous drop in productivity will reduce a currency's purchase power, they are not unfair reasons, they are part of the complex interrelations of nature and societies that shall motivate people to protect themselves from these type of 'agentless or unintentional risks'. On the other hand, some authority arbitrarily destroying people's purchase power by printing money would not enter the category of what is fair game.[..]"* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md)

## [Second defense of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/second-defense-non-inflationary-currency.md) <a name="art2"></a>
*This piece is a follow-up of my first one [on the fairness of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md).
Since I wrote that, some friends raised a couple of arguments which I'd like to address here. To be precise, I don't think these arguments are new, rather a variation of the ones discussed in the first piece, but still worth the effort of analysing them individually.* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/second-defense-non-inflationary-currency.md)

## [Printing money is a bad policy](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/printing-money-bad-policy.md) <a name="art3"></a>

*Natural catastrophes, ranging from climate-related ones to pandemics are part of the world we live in. If we want to be consistently moral and fair in our defense of how to improve the economy in such scenarios, the strategy we follow to protect us from the latest disaster must necessarily consider that there will be future ones. Not taking that into account ignores the future victims, which are a direct consequence of our current actions, of building a fragile society based on debt, spending and inflation; these future victims are as worthy of our protection as the current ones but, unluckily for them, they are harder to track and link to the original cause of their disgrace.* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/printing-money-bad-policy.md)

## [Price stability revisited](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/inflation-and-price-stability.md) <a name="art4"></a>

*...with a rate of monetary inflation pegged to productivity, we lose information about the evolution of the means of production of products and services. With no monetary inflation however, knowledge is better relayed since prices are attached to each element in the economy and affected by its relevant characteristics, instead of being aggregated into arbitrary indices which are unfairly composed and ignore the individual choices of each person.* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/inflation-and-price-stability.md)

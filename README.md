## [On the fairness of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md) <a name="art1"></a>


*"My intuition tells me that creating money out of thin air is not a good thing.
Another intuition I have is that whenever a person decides to delay spending their money and store away the value of their work, it is fair that no one should be able to arbitrarily take away their purchase power. Money can lose purchase power with time, but not all justifications are equaly just. While natural catastrophes or a spontaneous drop in productivity will reduce a currency's purchase power, they are not unfair reasons, they are part of the complex interrelations of nature and societies that shall motivate people to protect themselves from these type of 'agentless or unintentional risks'. On the other hand, some authority arbitrarily destroying people's purchase power by printing money would not enter the category of what is fair game.[..]"* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md)

## [Second defense of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/second-defense-non-inflationary-currency.md) <a name="art2"></a>
*This piece is a follow-up of my first one [on the fairness of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md).
Since I wrote that, some friends raised a couple of arguments which I'd like to address here. To be precise, I don't think these arguments are new, rather a variation of the ones discussed in the first piece, but still worth the effort of analysing them individually.* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/second-defense-non-inflationary-currency.md)

## [Verification of PlanB's Stock-to-flow model for the price of bitcoin](https://github.com/raulcano/bitcoin-analysis/blob/master/btc-analysis.ipynb) <a name="art3"></a>

*The purpose of this work is to replicate the results by PlanB in his article "[Modeling Bitcoin's Value with Scarcity](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)"[..] The dataset used in this exercise has been obtained as I explained in this other [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/raulcano/bitcoin-analysis/blob/master/btc-dataset.ipynb). 
I have purposedly used a different set than the one shared by PlanB in his GitHub page, in order to corroborate that there is no particular bias in the sources used by him.
Additionally, I used a total of 1158 datapoints, in contrast with the 111 used by PlanB in the original article.* [Read more](https://github.com/raulcano/bitcoin-analysis/blob/master/btc-analysis.ipynb)

## Introduction
This piece is a follow-up of my first one on the [fairness of a non-inflationary currency](https://github.com/raulcano/articles/blob/master/fairness-of-deflationary-currency.md).

Since I wrote that, some friends raised a couple of arguments which I'd like to address here. To be precise, I don't think these arguments are new, rather a variation of the ones discussed in the first piece, but still worth the effort of analysing them individually.

As a reminder, what I mean by "non-inflationary currency" is a currency of which no more monetary units can be created arbitrarily, that is, no authority has the power to print new bank notes or mint new coins. In the real world, that could be gold or bitcoin, but I am not speaking of either to make my point here. My defense rests on any currency having a reliable "unforgeable costliness", as Nick Szabo put it, regardless of which particular currency implements it. Also, by "deflation" I mean the increasing purchase power per monetary unit. 

I defend that it is fair to be able to buy more stuff with your money, given that no new coins are created and there is a continuous increase in productivity. Put in this way, it seems hard to disagree with the statement, but there are in fact some good-sounding arguments which I'd like to debunk.

# Premises <a name="premises"></a>
For clarity, I outline here the premises assumed in all the arguments in this topic:

1. The growth in productivity is stable. That is, the evolution in the means of production allows more output per unit of input continuously.
2. The amount of money is stable. There are no new monetary units created.

# Argument: price stability is good <a name="arg1"></a>
*It is fair to control the inflation so the new printed money keeps prices stable*

## Answer
I have no issue with prices being stable if that is what the market determines.
However, why would you want to keep prices stable artificially? To be able to buy the same amount of goods (or services) with your money? Ok, that seems fair. At least, initially. The issue I have with this argument is that the whole point of improving technology is to increase productivity in a way that makes things cheaper and more accessible to the population overall. That is, if stable prices are good, cheaper prices are much better.

Technology adds a deflationary pressure on the economy, since with the same amount of money one can buy more stuff. If more quantity of a good is produced with the same resources, it is normal and *fair* that its price be reduced.

Another consequence of the argument for price stability is that if you roll back long enough in history, let's say, back to when we were Homo habilis using the first tools, we should then spend most of our salaries *now* in a piece of wood or some plates, because the price should have remained stable throughout History.
Luckily enough that was not the case and the fact that we got better at developing techonology and prices were reduced for most things, we were allowed to allocate our time and resources on new things that improved our lives, up to mobile phones, food delivery, internet, you name it.

Let's not forget that prices give shape to a system that sums up the overwhelming amount of knowledge affecting all different goods and services in an economy. Distorting them is not only unnecesarry but also harmful.

# Argument: hoarding <a name="arg2"></a>
*The incentive is in saving (hoarding) and not in spending. This eventually diminishes economic activity, leading to bankrupcies, unemployment and other negative effects.*

## Answer

Even with the strongest incentive in saving, any person must at least spend enough in order to cover their basic necessities. Also, that person would also spend their money in those goods or services that bring them a better utility *now* than the expected utility that can be obtained *in the future*. Hence, for starters, the logic of human action leads us at least *some* spending is happening even with the most deflationary currency.

The question is if that level of deflation has a negative effect on the economy. That is, wouldn't you save as much as you can if you knew that you could buy double in a month with the same money? I believe that you probably would save more money compared with an inflationary alternative, but not as to live as a miser delaying every single pleasure you can enjoy for the future. In my opinion, people would be incentivized to spend their money in a more "responsible" way, since the money they spend *now* shall yield enough utility (in goods or services) to compensates for the loss in purchase power they give up *in the future*.

Another consequence of having more people capable of and incentivized to saving their income is that it increases the likelihood of investments, which are a necessary condition for premise 1 to hold. That is, some savers would ask themselves if they can beat the rate of deflation by investing their money instead of just hoarding it, so there would be spending in the form of new businesses which have to promise at least as high returns as the ones given by the deflationary trend itself. Those businesses create new job opportunities and contribute to a healthy economy by developing its productivity.

Another point stated in the argument, is that a non-inflationary currency would lead to bankrupcies. This is especially true if the amount of money in circulation decreases rapidly. Those who hold debt then will have to pay a bigger amount for their credit in terms of purchase power, since every time they have to pay a part of their debt that money is worth more and more. In that case, bankrupcies are likely to happen. However, as Jörg Guido Hülsmann puts it in his piece ["Deflation and Liberty"](https://mises.org/library/deflation-and-liberty-1): 

```
In short, the true crux of deflation is that it does not
hide the redistribution going hand in hand with
changes in the quantity of money. It entails visible misery
for many people, to the benefit of equally visible
winners. This starkly contrasts with inflation, which creates
anonymous winners at the expense of anonymous
losers. Both deflation and inflation are, from the point
of view we have so far espoused, zero-sum games. But
inflation is a secret rip-off and thus the perfect vehicle
for the exploitation of a population through its (false)
elites, whereas deflation means open redistribution
through bankruptcy according to the law
```

Coming back to the original argument, more savings (or hoarding, if you prefer the pejorative term) in the hands of citizens contribute to a more resilient society, especially in times of economic turmoil, uncertainty or depression. I won't go into the details of this point, but this alone seems to me a good reason to have a currency which favors saving.

# Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

Creating money out of thing air is a means of redistributing the wealth from the savers to the ones that receive the new money. By printing money, the currency is diluted and the value stored in savings goes mainly to those who receive the new money first.
This forced redistribution is terribly unfair, especially if citizens are forced by law to use the state-approved currency which is being debased. 

If the goal is to distribute wealth to the poor, there are better ways than inflation (which almost always benefit the rich and create an unfair redistribution).

Also, printing money to guarantee price stability does not need to be good per se. What needs to be stable is the reference against which we price our goods and services, so the price signal is sent around to all participants of the economy to do whatever they see fit. By keeping prices artificially stable, we lose a much valuable information and we fight an unnecesary battle against the deflationary force or technology and progress. Stable prices are good but cheaper prices are way better.

Saving money means that you lower your 'time preference', that is, you decide to not give in to your immediate impulses and rather prepare for an uncertain future or just delay any consumption you could do now. 
- If with time, your savings increase in value because society got more productive and you can buy more stuff with the same amount of money, that's a fair reward.
- If with time, your savings lose value because society got less productive or there was a catastrophe, that's fair as well. At least you would be more prepared than someone who didn't save, so in comparison you are better off (or not so hardly hit by the catastrophe).
- If with time, your savings lose value because money producers decided to print more money, that's unfair. Your savings lose value because of the interests of the money producers, which most likely won't be aligned with yours.

If the government didn't force you to use their money via legal-tender laws, and different monies were allowed to participate in a free market, then people could choose whatever money fit better for them. In this case, people could choose if the money printing by the government is something they would tolerate by staying in that currency or switching to a different one. With a free competition of monies, money printing would not be as unfair as when one is not allowed to exit a particular fiat currency.

I guess the underlaying issue I have with printing money is a question of liberty. In particular, the option of delaying consumption is unfairly punished: with inflation you are incentivized to spend because otherwise your savings lose value via the hidden tax of inflation. If the goverment only allows one money for you to store your savings, and at the same time, they dilute that money at their will, they are taking freedom from you to decide when to spend your hard-earned money.

The alternative, a non-inflationary currency, gives you a choice, gives you more freedom: do you want to spend? that's fine; do you want to save it for later? that's fine too.
